        "This section presents SQL queries originally designed for PostgreSQL, now adapted to run against an SQLite database. This adaptation ensures the notebook is self-contained and easily runnable without needing an external database server. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database engine, and Python has built-in support for it via the `sqlite3` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Adaptations for SQLite:**\n",
        "* **Data Types:** PostgreSQL's `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` is typically `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` in SQLite. Timestamps and dates are stored as `TEXT` in ISO8601 format (e.g., \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\") for better human readability and cross-platform compatibility, though SQLite can also store them as numbers (Julian day or Unix epoch).\n",
        "* **Date/Time Functions:** PostgreSQL-specific functions like `DATEADD`, `DATEDIFF`, and `INTERVAL` arithmetic are replaced with SQLite's date and time functions such as `date()`, `datetime()`, `strftime()`, and modifiers like `'+X days'`. Functions like `CURRENT_DATE` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` are generally available, though `datetime('now', 'localtime')` is often used to get the current timestamp adjusted for local time.\n",
        "* **Random Data Generation:** `random()` in PostgreSQL (returning a float between 0 and 1) is different from SQLite's `random()` (returning a large signed integer). We use `abs(random())` in SQLite to get positive random numbers for data generation.\n",
        "* **Aggregate Functions with CASE:** While `COUNT(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 END)` works in SQLite (counting non-NULL results), `SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` is sometimes used for clarity or if a zero count is explicitly desired when the condition is never met (though `COALESCE(COUNT(...), 0)` also achieves this).\n",
        "\n",
        "The next cell (CELL 6) will set up an **in-memory** SQLite database. This means the database and its data will only exist for the duration of the current notebook session and will be lost when the notebook kernel is shut down. It then creates the necessary table schemas and populates them with sample data relevant to the SQL queries that follow."

It compares user activity in two consecutive periods: the most recent 30 days versus the 30 days prior to that (i.e., 31-60 days ago). This proactive detection can help Customer Success teams intervene before a user churns.\n",

        "* **Percentage Change Calculation:** The percentage change in call count is calculated.\n",
        "* **Filtering:** The query filters for users who were previously active (e.g., more than 10 calls in the previous period) and have experienced a significant drop in usage (e.g., at least a 30% decline).\n",

This is vital for troubleshooting data integration issues. The query focuses on calls made within the last 7 days.\n",

        "* **Timestamp Comparison:** `datetime('now', '-7 days')` is used to define the 7-day window for recent calls.\n",
        "* **Time Difference Calculation:** To calculate `minutes_since_last_attempt`, SQLite's `strftime('%s', ...)` function is used. This converts timestamp strings into Unix epoch seconds (number of seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC). The difference between `datetime('now', 'localtime')` (current local time as epoch seconds) and the `last_sync_attempt` (as epoch seconds) is then divided by 60 to get minutes. Using `'localtime'` for `'now'` helps align with typical server log timings if the database timestamps are also stored in local time.\n",
